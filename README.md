# Vyachowski.com
Personal website for a fornt-end / back-end developer

## Branch Naming Convention

- **main** for the current version of site
- **develop** is for developing new features, test and refactor them

## Commit Naming Convention

A commit message should start with a category of change. You can pretty much use the following 4 categories for everything: feat, fix, refactor, and chore.

- **feat** is for adding a new feature
- **fix** is for fixing a bug
- **refactor** is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)
- **chore** is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)
- e.g. ```git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add new button components to templates'```
